                <div class="para">Geothermal energy is a powerful and sustainable source of renewable energy derived
                    from the Earth's internal heat. By tapping into the natural heat stored beneath the Earth's surface,
                    geothermal energy can be used for electricity generation, direct heating, and various industrial
                    applications. This comprehensive guide explores the fundamentals of geothermal energy, its benefits,
                    technologies, applications, and challenges.

                    <div class="heading">The Basics of Geothermal Energy</div>
                    <div class="para">Geothermal energy originates from the heat generated by the decay of radioactive
                        elements in the Earth's core, residual heat from the planet's formation, and heat from volcanic
                        activity. This heat is stored in rocks and water beneath the Earth's surface. The temperature of
                        geothermal resources increases with depth, and this heat can be harnessed for various energy
                        needs.

                        Geothermal energy is considered renewable because the heat extraction rate is significantly
                        lower than the Earth's natural heat replenishment rate. Additionally, it is a consistent and
                        reliable energy source, providing a steady supply of power regardless of weather conditions.
